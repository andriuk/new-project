1.  **Create a new directory in your environment with the name "new-project".**
    
    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you want to create the "new-project" directory. Then, use the `mkdir` command to create the directory:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    mkdir new-project
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate to the "new-project" directory.**
    
    Change your working directory to "new-project" using the `cd` command:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    cd new-project
    ```
    
3.  **Initialize a new public Git repository inside the "new-project" directory.**
    
    Use the `git init` command to create a new Git repository in the "new-project" directory:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    
    This initializes an empty Git repository in the "new-project" directory.
    
4.  **Create a new file named "README.md" and add some initial text to it.**
    
    You can create the "README.md" file using a text editor or the `touch` command (on Unix-based systems) and then edit it with a text editor:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    touch README.md
    ```
    
    Open the "README.md" file in a text editor and add some initial text. For example:
    
    markdown
    
    ```markdown
    # Welcome to My New Project
    
    This is the starting point for my new project.
    ```
    
5.  **Stage the "README.md" file for commit.**
    
    Use the `git add` command to stage the changes you made to the "README.md" file:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
    
6.  **Commit the changes to the repository with the commit message "init".**
    
    Now, commit the staged changes with a meaningful commit message. In this case, let's use "init" as the message:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "init"
    ```
    
    This creates your initial commit with the "README.md" file.
    
7.  **Create a new branch with the name "development" and switch to it.**
    
    To create a new branch and switch to it, use the `git checkout -b` command:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b development
    ```
    
    You have now created a new branch named "development" and switched to it. You can start working on this branch for your project's development.
